Integrate Google Tag Manager into  your website.

== Description ==

Integrate Google Tag Manager into your website.

The great thing about Google Tag Manager (GTM) is that you are able to gather most of your tracking scripts in one place. You can then fire these scripts whenever you want, specified by the rules you set up. This sounds great, right? Well it is.  The only problem is that sometimes it takes a bit of implementing to set these rules up. This implementation can either be setting a dataLayer variable in the dataLayer before the tag manager script is loaded, or pushing a HTML event handler with the variable "event" to the dataLayer when a button is clicked. The problem is that this isn’t always that easy to do when you don’t have the ability/access to add the code to your site.

This is where the Metronet Tag Manager plugin shines. It really unlocks the power of the dataLayer so you can easily set macros and firing rules on almost any element.

This plugin lets you:
<ul>
<li>Easily add as many dataLayer variables on a per-post and per-page basis as you need.</li>
<li>The plugin already gives you six predefined dataLayer variables that you can change/remove or test the system with. These will be loaded on all pages and posts.</li>
<li>Set up separate dataLayer variables for pages that aren’t posts or pages (like archives etc).</li>
<li>Lets you easily add a HTML event handler to any content link with the GTM TinyMCE  button in the WYSIWYG.</li>
<li>Lets you add your own unique ID or a class to each content link with the GTM TinyMCE button in the WYSIWYG.</li>
</ul>

Please note that for this plugin to work there is a slight customization that is needed. WordPress doesn’t let you load scripts straight after the opening <body> tag which is where the GTM script needs to be placed to work correctly. To fix this you need to add `<?php do_action( 'body_open' ); ?>` just after the `<body>` tag and that’s it.

> Note, if you are using WordPress 5.2. and up, contact your theme developer and ask them to insert `<?php wp_body_open(); ?>` just after the opening body tag of their theme. Here is some code to <a href="https://gist.github.com/ronalfy/6b7f43e70e644320aba67d1876a0aeff">show the theme developer to make it compatible with Metronet Tag Manager</a>.

== Filtering Variables ==

If you choose to place variable values inside percentage signs (e.g., %replace_test%), you can filter these as necessary.

Here's an example:
`
add_filter( 'gtm_replace_test', 'gtm_replace_test', 10, 3 );
function gtm_replace_test( $total_match, $match, $post_id ) {
	return "replaced with content";
}
`

The filter name is `gtm_` with the suffix of `replace_test`, since that content is inbetween the percentage signs.
